**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Discover vehicles with Todde-branded experience (Priority: P1)

A prospective buyer lands on the homepage, immediately understands Todde’s value proposition, browses featured vehicles, and filters listings within a consistent Todde-branded interface.

**Why this priority**: Establishes first impressions and drives core marketplace engagement; without it the site fails its primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Launch homepage staging environment, validate that hero, navigation, category icons, and product grid use Todde branding and allow end-to-end browsing without visual regressions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor arrives on the homepage, **When** the page loads on desktop or mobile, **Then** branding elements (logo, colors, typography) match the Todde palette and typography guide while hero copy communicates financing in ≤3 seconds of first paint.
2. **Given** a visitor interacts with the homepage filters, **When** they select a category icon, **Then** the icon highlights using the Todde orange ring and the product grid updates while preserving typography and spacing rules.

### User Story 2 - Evaluate financing eligibility (Priority: P2)

An interested shopper navigates to the financing page, reviews Todde’s financing explainer, steps, and calculator, and submits a financing inquiry without leaving the branded experience.

**Why this priority**: Converts browsing interest into financing leads; critical revenue driver after core browsing experience.

**Independent Test**: Validate financing page in isolation: hero, "How It Works" steps, banners, and forms adhere to Todde styles while enabling financing inquiry submission via existing backend endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor opens the financing page, **When** they scroll through the hero and "How It Works" sections, **Then** the typography, iconography, and CTA styling follow the Todde constitution and the content communicates the eight financing steps in order.
2. **Given** the visitor completes financing inputs, **When** they submit the inquiry, **Then** the confirmation messaging appears within the Todde design system with accessible contrast and spacing.

---

### User Story 3 - Access trust and support information (Priority: P3)

A user validates Todde’s credibility by reviewing testimonials, support contacts, and footer content styled consistently with the brand before deciding to proceed.

**Why this priority**: Reinforces trust and contact clarity; supports conversion but is secondary to browsing/financing flows.

**Independent Test**: Review dedicated sections (value proposition, footer) to confirm copy, icons, and layout communicate trust metrics while satisfying accessibility checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor reaches the value proposition section, **When** they read the bullets, **Then** each item uses approved iconography, typography, and spacing while highlighting Todde differentiators.
2. **Given** a visitor scrolls to the footer, **When** they review contact and social links, **Then** the layout follows the four-column structure with compliant colors and hover states.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when hero or product imagery fails to load? → Fallback to neutral background with descriptive alt text and maintains layout spacing.
- How does system handle financing form submission errors? → Display inline error messaging in Todde orange, preserve entered data, and offer retry/contact options.
- What if user has reduced-motion preferences enabled? → Disable non-essential animations and rely on color/weight cues.
- How are extremely long vehicle titles handled? → Truncate with ellipsis while providing full title in tooltip.
- What happens when the user visits from a low-bandwidth connection? → Serve optimized image variants and ensure primary copy loads before decorative assets.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The homepage MUST present Todde-branded navigation, hero, and product grid layouts that comply with the defined color, typography, spacing, and motion tokens.
- **FR-002**: The product grid MUST remain responsive across breakpoints (≥1024px, 600–1023px, ≤599px) while preserving card styling, hierarchy, and accessibility.
- **FR-003**: Category icon interactions MUST surface active states using the Todde orange ring, update listings accordingly, and support keyboard focus-visible styles.
- **FR-004**: Financing hero and "How It Works" sections MUST deliver Todde-aligned copy, imagery, and numbered steps that match the eight-step financing journey while reinforcing the fixed 30% down payment offer.
- **FR-005**: Financing inquiry flows MUST confirm submissions with Todde-styled messaging, keep users on-page with a branded confirmation banner, trigger an automated email follow-up, handle validation errors gracefully, and retain user inputs on failure.
- **FR-006**: Shared components (CTAs, banners, footers) MUST reference the centralized Todde design token library to avoid color/typography drift.
- **FR-007**: Imagery and icon assets MUST source from Todde’s approved media pack without alteration, include descriptive alt text, and degrade gracefully when unavailable.
- **FR-008**: All interactive elements MUST meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, focus, and reduced-motion guidelines while reflecting Todde’s voice.
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST be updated in the Todde design system knowledge base with any new component usage notes introduced by this feature.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Vehicle Listing**: Represents an available vehicle with attributes (make, model, price, imagery set, financing eligibility flags). Displays within the Todde-styled product grid.
- **Financing Program**: Captures financing terms (down payment percentage, installment duration, steps). Powers financing page content and calculator inputs.
- **Design Token**: Centralized definition of colors, typography scale, spacing, motion presets consumed across homepage and financing components.
- **Marketing Asset**: Imagery/icon files mapped to sections (hero, value proposition, CTA banners) with metadata for alt text and usage rights.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of homepage sessions display the correct Todde branding palette and typography on first paint, verified via visual regression snapshots.
- **SC-002**: 90% of financing page visitors reach the "How It Works" section with cumulative layout shift below 0.1 across supported breakpoints.
- **SC-003**: Financing inquiry completion rate increases by 20% compared to pre-branding baseline within 30 days of launch.
- **SC-004**: Post-launch brand alignment survey scores ≥4/5 average on "Visual consistency with Todde brand" from a sample of 50 participants.
- **SC-005**: Accessibility audits (axe-core + manual) report zero critical violations across homepage and financing flows prior to release.

## Assumptions

- Existing backend endpoints for vehicle listings and financing inquiries remain unchanged; feature focuses on presentation and UX alignment.
- Todde brand assets (logos, icons, photography) are available in production-ready formats before development begins.
- Content owners will provide updated copy where wording deviates from current PRD but must match Todde voice guidelines.
- Visual regression tooling and accessibility testing pipelines are available for validation during QA.
