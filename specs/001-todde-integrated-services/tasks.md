# Tasks: Todde Integrated Services Homepage & Financing Rebrand

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-todde-integrated-services/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly mandated in the spec. Include targeted verifications only where required for acceptance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1â€“US3) to ensure each slice is independently implementable and testable.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Task can run in parallel (no shared files/dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story label (US1, US2, US3)
- Provide absolute or clearly rooted file paths

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare tooling, environments, and repo scaffolding referenced by all stories.

- [ ] T001 [P] [Setup] Ensure branch `001-todde-integrated-services` is checked out and synced (git).

- [ ] T008 [Foundational] Implement design token pipeline: configure Style Dictionary build to generate `backend/apps/design_system/tokens.py`, `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`, and Flowbite overrides.
- [ ] T009 [Foundational] Integrate Tailwind + Flowbite asset build via Vite: update `frontend/vite.config.ts`, create `frontend/src/scripts/flowbite-init.ts`, ensure output to `backend/static/dist`.
- [ ] T010 [Foundational] Configure Django static settings and template loaders to consume Vite-built bundles (update `backend/todde_backend/settings/base.py` and `templates/base/base.html`).
- [ ] T011 [Foundational] Set up Celery with Redis, AnyMail provider configuration, and stub financing email task (`backend/apps/financing/tasks.py`).
- [ ] T012 [P] [Foundational] Seed baseline marketing assets and tokens fixtures (`backend/apps/marketing/fixtures/initial_assets.json`).
- [ ] T013 [Foundational] Establish accessibility testing harness using Playwright + axe (`tests/playwright/axe.config.ts`, sample spec).

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready â€“ user stories can commence.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 â€“ Evaluate financing eligibility (Priority P2)

**Goal**: Present financing explainer page with Flowbite-driven components, updated hero, how-it-works steps, calculator, and inquiry submission tied to Celery email confirmation.

**Independent Test**: Navigate directly to financing page, confirm content structure, adjust calculator inputs (fixed 30% messaging), submit inquiry, observe on-page confirmation and email queue status.

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] T026 [P] [US2] Implement `FinancingProgram` and `FinancingInquiry` models (fields/states per data-model.md) with admin + migrations (`backend/apps/financing/models.py`).
- [ ] T027 [US2] Build financing services: calculator logic, inquiry submission orchestration, Celery task invocation (`backend/apps/financing/services/eligibility.py`).
- [ ] T028 [US2] Implement financing API endpoints from `contracts/financing.yaml` (`backend/apps/financing/api.py`, serializers).
- [ ] T029 [US2] Create financing page view, forms, and Flowbite-based template (`backend/apps/financing/views/page.py`, `templates/pages/financing.html`).
- [ ] T030 [P] [US2] Develop frontend script for calculator interactivity and validation (`frontend/src/scripts/financing-calculator.ts`).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. **Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2**: Setup must complete before foundational tasks.
2. **Phase 2 â†’ Phases 3-5**: Foundational tasks block all user stories.
3. **User Stories**: US1 (P1) is MVP; US2 & US3 may run in parallel once Phase 2 finishes, provided team capacity and data dependencies (e.g., marketing assets) are ready.
4. **Phase 6** depends on completion of selected user stories.

### Story Dependency Graph

- US1 (P1) â†’ foundational requirement for brand consistency.
- US2 (P2) depends on foundational tasks plus shared design tokens but not on US1 deliverables (can parallel).
- US3 (P3) depends on foundational tasks; optionally consumes marketing assets defined during US1 but can proceed independently with fixtures.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks T001â€“T006 are parallel.
- Foundational tasks T008, T012, T013 can run parallel after T007.
- Within US1: T014/T015/T017/T021/T022/T024 parallelizable.
- Within US2: T026/T030/T032 in parallel; T027 â†’ T028 sequential; T029 parallel with T030 once models exist.
- Within US3: T035, T039 parallel; T037 depends on T036.

---

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP**: Complete Phases 1â€“3 (through US1) to deliver branded homepage.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Add US2 for financing experience, then US3 for trust content.
- **Quality Gates**: Execute automated suites (T042) and visual audits (T043) before release.
- **Documentation**: Keep design system artifacts and quickstart instructions in sync (T044, T045).
